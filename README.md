This repo is a monorepo for my personal portfolio. This contains all that is related to my personal website.
The effort is under #100DaysofCode, whose log in under writeups/100-days-of-code. The root directory structure
keeps the monorepo clean.

### The directory structure

- code: the code for the website
- design: design files
- writeups: any text document to go by
- rec: screen capture of these 100-ish days(not tracked though)
