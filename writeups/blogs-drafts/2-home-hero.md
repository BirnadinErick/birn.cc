# Home Hero

Today is Day 2 of 100. Today I managed to come up with a design for my hero.
I changed the layout I had in the wireframe little to a simple and minimalist
approach. Something like me 😊.

### Design

I designed my site to be in dark mode. You know why...


> I am planning to add light mode, but not sooner.

**Important Change** from the wireframe is I got rid of my picture, I am an
introvert btw, and stats. I really didn't know what stats to include as most
will be in `what-can-I-do-for-you` section.

### End of the day

This is what I end up with.

### Outcome

I learned frontend engineering is not that much ard when you chose to go with
an minimalist approach. Tailwindcss really helps CSS alegies like me 🙏.
