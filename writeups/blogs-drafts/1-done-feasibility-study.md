# Prologue: Feasibility Study, Requirements Analysis, sitemap and the stack

## Feasibility Study

As I twitted [Day-0](https://twitter.com/birnadin/status/1628543481214914561),
I have decided to build personal website; within upcoming 100 days. Today, the
Day 01(Feb 23, 2023) I have finished Feasibility Study for v1.0.0 üéâ. Took me
some research whether can I do this. Here are my report.

1. Operatioal: ‚úÖ. Lit bit of tinkering here & there, I can operate easily.
2. Economic: ‚úÖ. First, it worths it & got tricks up sleeve to reduce cost.
3. Chronological: ‚úÖ‚úÖ. Since I am taking a vaca from all, this is the time.

Apart from these 3 factors, I can manage others. That's very short non-pro
study by a Backend Engineer üòâ.

## Requirements Analysis

At first, I wanted like everything on my portfolio, e.g., blogs, projects,
hire-me, e-shop(ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), my vlog, podcasts etc. But wen **zen** and decided

- about-me
- skills
- projects
- blogs
- contacts

are well enough for now. Anything can arise in v2.0.0. These key points will
also serve as my ***functional*** requirements as well.

## sitemap

<!-- TODO: insert sitemap here -->

I will have the home page that have 4 main sections:-

1. hero: about-me essentially
2. skills: what am I capable of
3. projects: what have I done
4. footer: where to next kinda

Simple and sweet for now. The *global navbar* will contain links to separate
pages of the site. They being:-

- home
- projects
- blogs
- hire-me CTA

Here, `projects` and `blogs` branch out to separate pages for *detail view*.

## the stack

<!-- TODO: insert the stack here -->

I didn't go fancy, just what I am comfortable with. I chose 
[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) with [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com)
because afterall I am just Backend Engineer with somewhat non-pro Frontend skill.
However I could have gone with [Flutter](https://flutter.github.io/) which I am
well comfortable with, but I don't really like drawing onto Canvas which I could
easily done with primitive HTML5 elements.

## Bonus: Deployment

As I mentioned in the Feasibility Study section, for Economic, I figured few
stuff up.

For DDos and Front Facing Cache, I will have [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com).
As host, I will use [Vercel](https://vercel.com) as it is less pain in the a\*\*
in my opinion. My projects metadata will be pulled from [GitHub](https://github.com)
and the blogs will be from [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com).

the images will be `webp` and I am planning to use 
[ISR(incremental server side rendering)](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-vercel#incremental-static-regeneration).

## Epilogue

I think that's it for today. Till I meet in another one, it's *me the BE*,
signing off üëã.
